# Deploy to Railway - Step by Step

## âœ… Pre-Deployment Verification PASSED

All required API keys tested and working:
- âœ… Anthropic (Claude) - Working
- âœ… Alpaca Trading - Portfolio: $890.38
- âœ… FMP (Fundamentals) - Working

---

## Step 1: Go to Railway (30 seconds)

**URL:** https://railway.app/new

1. Click **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
2. Select: `cppt7094/microcap_agent`
3. Click **"Deploy Now"**

Railway will auto-detect Python and start building.

---

## Step 2: Add Environment Variables (1 minute)

### Click "Variables" â†’ "Raw Editor"

**Your API keys have been verified and saved in:**
- `RAILWAY_ENV_VARS.txt` (local file - not in GitHub)

**Copy the contents of that file and paste into Railway's Raw Editor.**

Or manually add these variables:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_from_env_file
ALPACA_API_KEY=your_key_from_env_file
ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your_key_from_env_file
ALPACA_BASE_URL=https://api.alpaca.markets
FMP_API_KEY=your_key_from_env_file
PORT=8000
```

**Click "Save"**

Railway will automatically redeploy with the new variables.

---

## Step 3: Wait for Build (2 minutes)

Click **"Deployments"** â†’ Watch the build log

You should see:
```
âœ“ Installing dependencies...
âœ“ Building application...
âœ“ Starting server...
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

---

## Step 4: Get Your URL (10 seconds)

Railway generates a URL like:
```
https://microcap-agent-production-XXXX.up.railway.app
```

Find it in:
- **Settings** â†’ **Domains** â†’ **Generate Domain**

Or it's shown automatically in the deployment overview.

---

## Step 5: Test Your Deployment (1 minute)

### 5.1 Health Check
```bash
curl https://YOUR-URL.up.railway.app/health
```

Should return:
```json
{"status": "healthy"}
```

### 5.2 Test Portfolio
```bash
curl https://YOUR-URL.up.railway.app/api/portfolio
```

Should return your real Alpaca portfolio ($890.38).

### 5.3 Test Multi-Agent Analysis
```bash
curl "https://YOUR-URL.up.railway.app/api/recommendations/analyze/APLD?apply_risk=true"
```

Should return:
- 4 agent votes
- Meta-Agent consensus
- Risk Committee position sizing
- Final recommendation

### 5.4 Open Dashboard
```bash
# In browser, go to:
https://YOUR-URL.up.railway.app/
```

You should see your real-time trading dashboard.

---

## Step 6: Verify Logs (30 seconds)

Click **"Deployments"** â†’ Latest â†’ **"View Logs"**

Look for:
```
âœ“ Analyst team initialized (Technical, Fundamental, Sentiment, Risk)
âœ“ Risk Committee initialized
âœ“ Meta-Agent initialized
âœ“ Alpaca REST API initialized successfully
âœ“ Portfolio: $890.38
```

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Build failed"
**Fix:** Check logs for missing dependencies. Usually auto-resolved on retry.

### Issue: "API key error"
**Fix:** Verify environment variables in Railway â†’ Variables. Make sure no extra spaces.

### Issue: "Application error"
**Fix:** Check logs. Usually means:
- Missing environment variable
- API key typo
- Need to redeploy after adding variables

### Issue: Slow first request
**Normal:** Railway apps sleep after inactivity. First request wakes it (~10 seconds).
