    "reasoning": "**CONSENSUS DECISION:**\n\nThe core debate centers on whether 85% confidence justifies aggressive sizing (30%) to maximize gains from strong momentum, versus maintaining prudent risk management given the already elevated 35% sector exposure. Risk-Seeking argues for capitalizing on high-conviction opportunities, while Risk-Conservative emphasizes portfolio balance and capital preservation. Risk-Neutral's 18% proposal offers reasonable middle ground but doesn't adequately address the sector concentration risk.\n\n**FINAL RECOMMENDATION:** 15% position size with 12% stop loss. This balances the high conviction level while respecting existing sector exposure limits and maintaining proper diversification.",
